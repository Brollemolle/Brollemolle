# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 

Hi there! I'm **Adam Brolin**, a third-year Information Technology student at **[KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/informationsteknik/informationsteknik-civilingenjor-300-hp-1.4120)** in Stockholm. I'm passionate about programming, problem-solving, and continuously expanding my technical skills. 


## About Me

I’m a hardworking and motivated student with a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving. My technical expertise lies primarily in **C** and **Java**, but I’m always eager to learn new technologies and environments. I thrive under pressure and enjoy tackling challenging problems, whether in academic projects or real-world scenarios.
